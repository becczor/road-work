# road-work
Visualization of traffic accidents in the UK. This project was part of the course TNM048 Information Visualization at Link√∂ping University, spring semester of 2018.

## The data
The data set comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales/), and has been modified to minimize the load on the browser. 464,697 entries with 31 properties each has been boiled down to 35,838 entries, about 8% of the original set, and with 15 properties each.

## Try it!
The application can be found [here](becczor.github.io/road-work), published on GitHub pages. Beware of a big load on you browser and therefore a bit slow application, depending on the power of your computer.
